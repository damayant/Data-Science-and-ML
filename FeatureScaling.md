## Importance of Feature Scaling 
Feature scaling is an essential step during data preprocessing, especially when dealing with machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of input features. 
Here are the reasons why feature scaling is important:
- <strong>Normalization of Features</strong>: Feature scaling brings the features to a similar scale, typically between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1.
  This normalization prevents features with larger magnitudes from dominating those with smaller magnitudes.
  It ensures that all features contribute proportionally to the learning process and prevents bias in favor of certain features.
- <strong>Effective Distance Measures</strong>: Many machine learning algorithms rely on distance calculations, such as Euclidean distance or gradient descent.
  If features are not scaled, those with larger scales can have a higher impact on distance calculations or optimization steps.
  Scaling the features allows for more accurate distance measures and optimization processes.
- <strong>Improved Convergence</strong>: Some optimization algorithms converge faster when features are scaled.
  Gradient-based optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, can converge more quickly when features have similar scales.
  Feature scaling can help accelerate the convergence and improve the efficiency of the learning process
