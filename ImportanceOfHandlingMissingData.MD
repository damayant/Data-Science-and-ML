## Why do we need to handle missing data
Handling missing values is an important step in data preprocessing to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset. There are several common techniques to deal with missing values:

Deleting Rows: If the number of missing values is relatively small compared to the total dataset, you can simply remove the rows with missing values. However, this approach is only suitable if the missing values are randomly distributed and not informative for your analysis.

Deleting Columns: If a specific feature has a large number of missing values or is irrelevant to your analysis, you can choose to remove the entire column. Similar to deleting rows, this approach should be used cautiously to avoid losing valuable information.

Imputation: Imputation involves filling in the missing values with estimated or predicted values. The choice of imputation method depends on the type of data and the characteristics of the missingness. Some common imputation techniques include:

Mean/Median/Mode Imputation: Fill the missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the respective feature. This method is simple but assumes that the missing values are missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR).

Regression Imputation: Predict the missing values using a regression model based on other variables in the dataset. This method is useful when there is a relationship between the missing values and other features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation: Estimate missing values by finding the K most similar records based on other variables and using their values to fill in the missing values. This method is suitable when there is no specific pattern in the missingness and the data points can be considered interchangeable.

Multiple Imputation: Generate multiple imputed datasets by creating plausible values for missing data based on observed data and statistical models. Multiple imputation accounts for the uncertainty of imputed values and is often preferred in complex analyses.

Indicator/Dummy Variables: Create an additional binary indicator variable to signify whether a value was missing or not. This approach allows the model to capture any patterns or relationships associated with missingness.

The choice of missing value handling technique depends on the specific dataset, the amount of missing data, and the nature of the analysis or model being used. It's important to consider the potential impact of each approach on the integrity of the data and the validity of the subsequent analysis.
