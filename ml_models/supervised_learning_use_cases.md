#### 1. Supervised Learning Use Cases
- <strong> Email Spam Classification </strong>: Given a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam," a supervised learning algorithm can be trained to classify new incoming emails as either spam or not spam based on their features.
- <strong> Handwritten Digit Recognition </strong>: Using a dataset of labeled images of handwritten digits (e.g., the MNIST dataset), a supervised learning algorithm can be trained to recognize and classify handwritten digits from new, unseen images.
- <strong> Predictive Maintenance </strong>: By using historical sensor data from machines that have failed in the past, a supervised learning model can be trained to predict when a machine is likely to fail, enabling proactive maintenance.
