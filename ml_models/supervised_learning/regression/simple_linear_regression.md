Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used in simple linear regression to estimate the coefficients of a linear equation that best fits a given set of data points. It minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. The significance of OLS in simple linear regression lies in its ability to provide an optimal solution and infer relationships between variables.

Real-life examples:
1. Housing Prices: Simple linear regression can be used to analyze the relationship between the size of a house (in square feet) and its price. By applying OLS, we can estimate the coefficient that quantifies the effect of size on price.

2. Advertising Spending: Suppose you want to determine the impact of advertising spending on sales for a particular product. Simple linear regression using OLS can help estimate the relationship between the two variables and provide insights into the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.

Python code implementation:
Here's an example of implementing simple linear regression using OLS in Python with the help of the `statsmodels` library:

```python
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Sample data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Independent variable (e.g., advertising spending)
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])  # Dependent variable (e.g., sales)

# Add a constant term to the independent variable
x = sm.add_constant(x)

# Fit the model using OLS
model = sm.OLS(y, x)
results = model.fit()

# Print the regression coefficients
print(results.params)
```

In this code snippet, we first create a numpy array `x` to represent the independent variable (e.g., advertising spending) and `y` to represent the dependent variable (e.g., sales). We then add a constant term to the independent variable using `sm.add_constant()`, as OLS expects a constant term by default.

Next, we fit the OLS model using `sm.OLS(y, x)` and obtain the results by calling `fit()`. The `results.params` line prints the estimated coefficients, which include the intercept term and the coefficient for the independent variable.
