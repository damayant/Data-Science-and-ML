# Types Of Classification

In supervised learning, classification is a type of learning where the goal is to assign input instances to predefined categories or classes. There are various types of classification algorithms, each suited for different types of data and problem domains. Here are some commonly used classification algorithms along with real-life use cases and Python code implementations:

1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Use Case: Email Spam Detection
   - Description: Logistic Regression is used to model the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It is a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

     # Create a Logistic Regression classifier
     classifier = LogisticRegression()

     # Train the classifier
     classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
     ```

2. **Decision Trees**:
   - Use Case: Customer Churn Prediction
   - Description: Decision Trees partition the input space based on feature values and make decisions based on a tree-like flowchart structure.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

     # Create a Decision Tree classifier
     classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()

     # Train the classifier
     classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
     ```

3. **Random Forests**:
   - Use Case: Image Classification
   - Description: Random Forests combine multiple decision trees to create an ensemble model. Each tree is trained on a random subset of features and contributes to the final prediction.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

     # Create a Random Forest classifier
     classifier = RandomForestClassifier()

     # Train the classifier
     classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
     ```

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - Use Case: Text Classification
   - Description: SVM is a powerful algorithm for both binary and multi-class classification. It finds an optimal hyperplane that separates instances of different classes with the largest margin.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.svm import SVC

     # Create an SVM classifier
     classifier = SVC()

     # Train the classifier
     classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
     ```
   ### There are different other types of SVMs : [Check this link for more details](https://github.com/damayant/Data-Science-and-ML/blob/master/ml_models/supervised_learning/classification/svms.md)

5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Use Case: Handwritten Digit Recognition
   - Description: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies instances based on their similarity to k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

     # Create a KNN classifier
     classifier = KNeighborsClassifier()

     # Train the classifier
     classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
     ```

These are just a few examples of classification algorithms and their implementations in Python. Real-life use cases can vary widely, but these examples demonstrate the application of classification algorithms in various domains such as email spam detection, customer churn prediction, image classification, text classification, and handwritten digit recognition. Depending on the specific problem and data characteristics, different algorithms may yield different performance, so it's important to choose the appropriate algorithm based on the problem requirements and evaluate their effectiveness on the given dataset.
