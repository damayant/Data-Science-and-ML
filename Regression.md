# Types of Regression
In supervised learning, regression is a type of learning where the goal is to predict a continuous or numerical value based on input features. There are different types of regression algorithms suited for various data types and problem domains. Here are some commonly used regression algorithms along with real-life use cases and Python code implementations:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Use Case: House Price Prediction
   - Description: Linear regression models the relationship between the input features and the target variable using a linear equation. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

     # Create a Linear Regression model
     regressor = LinearRegression()

     # Train the model
     regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
     ```

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   Multiple Linear Regression is a regression technique that models the relationship between multiple independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

Use Cases of Multiple Linear Regression:
1. Predicting House Prices: Using features such as area, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors to predict the price of a house.
2. Sales Forecasting: Predicting sales figures based on advertising expenses, promotional activities, and other factors.
3. Demand Prediction: Estimating the demand for a product based on factors like price, competitors' prices, marketing efforts, etc.
4. Financial Analysis: Analyzing the impact of different factors on stock prices or predicting future stock prices.
5. Customer Behavior Analysis: Understanding how various factors such as age, income, and education level influence customer behavior and purchase decisions.

Python Code Implementation:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create a Linear Regression model
regressor = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on new data
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
```

In the code, `X_train` represents the training data with multiple independent variables, `y_train` represents the corresponding target values for the training data, and `X_test` is the test data on which predictions are made. The `fit` method is used to train the model, and the `predict` method is used to make predictions on new data.

It's important to preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables before applying the Multiple Linear Regression model. Additionally, evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared is recommended.

3. **Polynomial Regression**:
   Polynomial Regression is a regression technique that models the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable as an nth-degree polynomial equation. It extends the concept of linear regression by introducing polynomial terms to capture non-linear relationships between the variables.

Use Cases of Polynomial Regression:
1. Stock Market Analysis: Predicting stock prices based on historical data, considering the non-linear trends observed in the stock market.
2. Environmental Studies: Analyzing the relationship between pollution levels and factors such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed to understand the impact of environmental variables.
3. Medicine and Healthcare: Investigating the relationship between dosage and the response of a drug, where the response may not be linear.
4. Marketing Research: Analyzing consumer behavior and predicting sales based on factors like advertising expenditure, price, and promotional activities.
5. Physics and Engineering: Modeling physical phenomena where the relationship between variables follows a non-linear pattern.

Python Code Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create polynomial features
degree = 2  # Define the degree of the polynomial
poly_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degree)
X_poly = poly_features.fit_transform(X)

# Create a Linear Regression model
regressor = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
regressor.fit(X_poly, y)

# Make predictions on new data
X_test_poly = poly_features.transform(X_test)
y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test_poly)
```

In the code, `X` represents the independent variable(s) data, `y` represents the corresponding dependent variable data. The `PolynomialFeatures` class is used to create polynomial features up to a specified degree. Then, the linear regression model is applied to the transformed features. The `fit_transform` method is used to fit the polynomial features to the training data and transform it, while the `transform` method is used to transform the test data using the same polynomial features.

It's important to choose an appropriate degree for the polynomial based on the complexity of the relationship between variables. Higher degrees may lead to overfitting. Additionally, feature scaling and other preprocessing steps may be required before applying Polynomial Regression. Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared is recommended.

5. **Decision Tree Regression**:
   - Use Case: Predicting Bike Rental Demand
   - Description: Decision tree regression models the target variable by splitting the feature space based on feature values and predicting the average target value within each split.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

     # Create a Decision Tree Regression model
     regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor()

     # Train the model
     regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
     ```

6. **Random Forest Regression**:
   - Use Case: Predicting Sales Revenue
   - Description: Random forest regression combines multiple decision trees to create an ensemble model. Each tree is trained on a random subset of features and contributes to the final prediction by averaging the predictions of all trees.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

     # Create a Random Forest Regression model
     regressor = RandomForestRegressor()

     # Train the model
     regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
     ```

4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:
   - Use Case: Stock Price Prediction
   - Description: Support Vector Regression uses support vector machines to perform regression. It finds an optimal hyperplane that approximates the relationship between input features and target variables.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.svm import SVR

     # Create an SVR model
     regressor = SVR()

     # Train the model
     regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
     ```

7. **Gradient Boosting Regression**:
   - Use Case: Demand Forecasting
   - Description: Gradient Boosting Regression builds an ensemble of weak prediction models, such as decision trees, and combines them to make accurate predictions. It iteratively trains new models to correct the errors of previous models.
   - Python Implementation:

     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

     # Create a Gradient Boosting Regression model
     regressor = GradientBoostingRegressor()

     # Train the model
     regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

     # Make predictions on new data
     y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
     ```

These are just a few examples of regression algorithms and their implementations in Python. Real-life use cases can vary widely, but these examples demonstrate the application of regression algorithms in domains such as house price prediction, bike rental demand, sales revenue prediction, stock price prediction, and demand forecasting. The choice of the regression algorithm depends on the nature of the data, the relationship between the
